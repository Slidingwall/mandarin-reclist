# 发音指导 Pronunciation instruction

对于非中文母语者而言，想掌握汉语拼音的一个难处在于每个字母可能对应多个不同的发音。  
For non-native Chinese speakers, one of the difficulties in mastering Hanyu Pinyin is that each letter may correspond to multiple different sounds.  
不过好消息是，录制用于歌唱的语音库不需要考虑音调的问题。  
The good news, though, is that recording a voice library for singing doesn't need to take into account the pitch.  
你可以通过现有的语音库来指导发声，或者搜索相关的教学视频。  
You can use your existing voice library to guide vocalization, or search for relevant instructional videos.   

您可以参考[发音记号表](/vocaloid-dictionaries/symbol-charts)以便从其它语言中获得与普通话相近的发音。  
You can refer to the [Symbol Charts](/vocaloid-dictionaries/symbol-charts) to get pronunciations similar to Mandarin from other languages.

下面会简单讲解一下每个拼音的发音。  
The following will briefly explain the pronunciation of each pinyin.  

## b/p,d/t,g/k

这三对拼音以浊音字母表示不送气的清辅音，以清音字母表示送气的清辅音。例如，`b`的发音就是英语里不送气的`p`,而`p`的发音则是英语里送气的`p`。  
These three pairs of pinyin use voiced letters to represent the unaspirated unvoiced consonants, and unvoiced letters to represent the aspirated unvoiced consonants. For example, the `b` is pronounced as the unaspirated `p` in English, and the `p` is pronounced as the aspirated `p` in English.  

## m,f,n,l,h

前四个拼音与英文中对应的发音完全一致。`h`为清软腭擦音，即西班牙语里的`h`。不过，中国南方地区的普通话也会将其读作英语里的`h`。  
The first four pinyin sounds are exactly the same as their English counterparts. The `h` is a voiceless velar fricative, which is the `h` in Spanish. However, Mandarin in southern China also pronounces it as the `h` in English.  

## z/c,s

前两个分别是英语中不送气和送气的`ts`,最后一个与英语中的`s`相同。  
The first two are the `ts` for unaspirated and aspirated in English, respectively, and the last one is the same as the `s` in English.  

## j/q,x

前两个更像日语里的`chi(ち)`，同样也是一个不送气一个送气。最后一个更像日语里的`shi(し)`。中国的部分流行歌手会故意把这三个音发成`zh/ch,sh`，这是比较有争议的发音改动。  
The first two are more like the Japanese word for `chi (ち)`, which is also an unaspirated and an aspirated. The last one is more like the Japanese word for `shi(し)`. Some Chinese pop singers will deliberately pronounce these three sounds as `zh/ch,sh`, which is a more controversial pronunciation change.  

## zh/ch,sh/r

虽然不是同一个音标，但是第一对会更像英语里的`tʃ`，就像`Church`里的`ch`一样，也是一个不送气一个送气。  
Although it is not the same phonetic alphabet, the first pair will be more like the `tʃ` in English, like the `ch` in `Church`, one is one without aspiration and one aspirated.   
  
第二对则更像英语里的`ʃ`和`ʒ`，`sh`比较像英语`share`里的`sh`，`r`比较像英语里`measure`中`s`的发音。需要注意的是，这只是近似的音标。它们正确的音标应该是`tʂ` `tʂʰ` `ʂ`和`ʐ`。  
The second pair is more like the `ʃ` and `ʒ` in English, the `sh` is more like the `sh` in `share`, and the `r` is more like the `s` in `measure`. It is important to note that this is only an approximate phonetics. Their correct phonetics should be `tʂ`, `tʂh`, `ʂ` and `ʐ`.  

## y(i-),w(u-)

当韵母`i` `u`或者韵头为`i-` `u-`的韵母单独作为一个音节时，它们会被写作`y`和`w`。它们和英语里`y` `w`的发音几乎一样。  
When the vowels `i` `u` or the vowels with the medial `i-` `u-` are used as a single syllable, they are written as `y` and `w`. They are almost identical to the `y` and `w` pronunciations in English.  

## a,o,e,i,u,ü

这六个是汉语中的单韵母。  
These six are the single vowels in Chinese.  

`a` `o` `i`与日语中的`a` `o` `i`相同。不过，日常发音中的`o`更偏向于`uo`，即使是与声母组合时（如`bo` `po` `mo` `fo`）也如此。此外，`i`在`zi` `ci` `si`中的发音更靠后（`ɨ`），在`zhi` `chi` `shi` `ri`中的发音具有卷舌（`ɨ˞`）。这两者的声音听起来可能会比较像日语的`u`。  
`a` `o` `i` is the same as `a` `o` `i` in Japanese. However, the `o` in everyday pronunciation is more likely to be `uo`, even when combined with initials (e.g. `bo`, `po`, `mo`, `fo`). In addition, the `i` is pronounced more back in `zi`, `ci`, `si`(`ɨ`), and the pronunciation in `zhi` `chi` `shi` `ri` has a curly tongue (`ɨ˞`). The sound of both may sound more like the Japanese `u`.   

`e`在单独出现时的发音为`ɤ`，这个发音有点像`cup`中的`u`。`u`的发音与英语`who`中的原因相同。`ü`的发音同法语的`u`或者德语的`ü`，这个拼音在同`j` `q` `x`组合时会写作`u`，单独作为一个音节时会写作`yu`，只有在同`n` `l`组合时才会写为`ü`。这种情况在日常打字及本录音表中会记作`v`。  
The `e` is pronounced `ɤ` when it appears alone, which is a bit like the `u` in `cup`. The pronunciation of `u` is the same as in the English `who`. The pronunciation of `ü` is the same as the French `u` or the German `ü`, and this pinyin is written as `u` when combined with `j`, `q` and `x`, and `yu` when it is used as a syllable alone, which is only written as `ü` when combined with `n` and `l`. This is noted as `v` in everyday typing and in this recording sheet.  

## ai,ei,ui,ao,ou,iu

这些双元音在英语中都可以找得到。`ai`的发音就像字母`I`，`ei`的发音就像字母`A`，`ao`的发音就像`now`中的`ow`，不过`a`的发音更靠后（`ɑ`），`ou`的发音就像字母`O`。`ui`和`iu`实质上是`uei`和`iou`的缩写。`uei`的发音类似`way`，而`iou`的发音则更像`yogurt`的第一个音节（`jəu-gət`）。请注意，它与字母`U`或者英语`you`的发音（`ju:`）不同。  
These diphthongs can be found in English. `ai` is pronounced like the letter `I`, `ei` is pronounced like the letter `A`, `ao` is pronounced like `ow` in `now`, but the `a` is pronounced more back (`ɑ`), and `ou` is pronounced like the letter `O`. `ui` and `iu` are essentially abbreviations of `uei` and `iou`. `uei` is pronounced like `way`, while `iou` is pronounced more like the first syllable of `yogurt` (`jəu-gət`). Note that it is not the same as the letter `U` or the English pronunciation of `you` (`ju:`).

## ie,üe,er

`e`在前两个拼音中的发音类似`bed`中的`e`。`ie`的发音与`yes`中的`ye`相同，而`üe`的发音就是由`ü`滑向`e`。`er`是儿化音，发音类似`better`里的`er`。此外，由于这里不会发生`u` `ü`混淆，因此录音表中将`üe`写作`ue`，即使在`lue` `nue`中也是如此。  
The pronunciation of `e` in the first two pinyin is similar to the `e` in `bed`. The `ie` is pronounced the same as the `ye` in `yes`, and the `üe` is pronounced from `ü` to `e`. `er` is a rhotic sound, which is pronounced like the `er` in `better`. Also, since the `u` `ü` confusion does not occur here, the `üe` is written as `ue` in the recording sheet, even in `lue` `nue`.

## an,en,in,un,ün

这几个是前鼻音，它们分别是对应的韵母同`n`结合而成的。需要注意的是，`en`中的`e`在这里发`ə`的音，类似`London`的第二个音节。而`un`是`uen`的缩写，它的发音更像是轻读时的`when`。此外，由于`l` `n`不会在常用音节中与`ün`结合，录音表中的`ün`均被写为`un`。  
These are prenasal sounds, and they are formed by combining the corresponding finals with `n`, respectively. It should be noted that the `e` in `en` is pronounced `ə` here, similar to the second syllable of `London`. And `un` is an abbreviation of `uen`, and its pronunciation is more like `when` when pronounced lightly. In addition, since `l` `n` is not combined with `ün` in common syllables, `ün` in the Reclist is written as `un`.   

需要注意的是，当`an`与`i-` `ü-`组合时，`a`的发音将变为`ɛ`，更像`dress`中的`e`。不过，同`u-`组合的时候不会发生这种音变。此外，由于`l` `n`不会在常用音节中与`üan`结合，录音表中的`üan`均被写为`uan`。  
It should be noted that when `an` is combined with `i-` and `ü-`, the pronunciation of `a` will change to `ɛ`, more like the `e` in `dress`. However, this change does not occur when combined with `u-`. In addition, since `l` `n` is not combined with `üan` in common syllables, `üan` in the Reclist is written as `uan`.  

## ang,eng,ing,ong

这几个是后鼻音，它们分别是对应的韵母同`ng`结合而成的。需要注意的是，`ang`中的`a`在这里发`ɑ`的音，像`tongue`不过口型更大，`eng`中的`e`在这里发`ə`的音，像`melancholy`中的第二个音节，`ong`中的`o`在这里发`ʊ`的音。  
These are post-nasal sounds, and they are formed by combining the corresponding finals with `ng`, respectively. It should be noted that the `a` in `ang` pronounces `ɑ` here, like a `tongue` but the mouth is more open, the `e` in `eng` pronounces `ə` here, like the second syllable in `melancholy`, and the `o` in `ong` pronounces `ʊ` here.
